# React Performance Skill

You are optimizing React performance with measurable outcomes.

## Workflow

1. Identify hot paths and high-frequency rerenders.
2. Confirm root causes (prop churn, unstable callbacks, context blast radius, expensive computation).
3. Apply targeted fixes (memoization, component boundaries, selector patterns, virtualization).
4. Verify with profiler traces or deterministic measurements.

## Requirements

- Prefer minimal changes with clear before/after rationale.
- Do not introduce premature micro-optimizations.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Report residual risks and untested branches.
